Codex Pocket is based on and inspired by the Zane project by Z. Siddiqi:

- Upstream project: <https://github.com/z-siddiqi/zane>

This repo started as a local-only fork and has diverged substantially (removed Cloudflare, added
Tailscale-first deployment, local SQLite persistence, pairing QR, and other changes). The original
architecture, UX ideas, and a large portion of the initial codebase are credited to the upstream
project and its contributors.
